# Smart Contract

The core of this project is a smart contract that is written in Solidity and deployed to the Ethereum-based testnet GÃ¶rli.

The smart contract is defined in contract/permissions.sol.

At the time of this writing, info about the latest deployment can be found at https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x0147fe45f5d96a6d0055bc89721f25da514e6aac.

# Decryption Service

This service downloads a file with a given content ID from IPFS (a decentralized storage protocol) and decrypts it using a secret key. 

Decryption only occurs if the user/wallet calling the service has been granted access to the file, as defined in the smart contract.

A user can obtain access to the file by sending 1000 wei (the smallest denomination of Ethereum) to the smart contract.

The decryption service is defined in the decryption_service directory, and the business logic is in download_decrypt.py. 

The service is currently deployed on a centralized platform, AWS, until I can find a decentralized solution to storing the secret key. Specifically, it's deployed in a Docker-based Lambda function as defined in sam_template.yaml and Dockerfile. The secret key is stored in AWS Secrets Manager. 

The encrypted file is pinned using Pinata, an IPFS pinning service, to ensure that it is always available.
